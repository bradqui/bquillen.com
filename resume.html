                <h3>Yahoo</h3><span class="right">2014-Present</span>
                <h4>Principal Software Development Engineer</h4>
                <h5>Sunnyvale, CA</h5>
                <p>As a Principal developer, my scope of responsibility includes the oversight and architectural design of Yahoo's Help web properties (including http://help.yahoo.com/),
                Yahoo's CRM platform, and the Corporate Platforms department's other wide range of platforms, tools, and web sites.</p>
                <p>During this time, I designed and led the implementation of a department wide service-oriented architecture platform named HelpWS.  Corporate Platforms has many systems that all must work together.
                These systems had been pieced together over many years, and any migration of any of the individual systems created systemic problems in many other connecting systems.  HelpWS
                creates a middle service layer for all the endpoints.  Using a standardized REST API framework, any systems that are migrated only have impact to the middle services layer, and
                do not affect other services within the department.</p>
                <p>I also designed and led the implementation of a modular, AJAX and web services based computer telephony integration platform named yCTI and yCallbar.  The CTI platform
                is a backend service layer that communicates with the telephony system, and provides web service based updates using JavaScript long polling techniques.  The CRM
                and telephony systems are obfuscated through modules, so that any migration impact between CRM or telephony systems would be minimal.  The client, yCallbar, is a single mobile-friendly
                web page application that uses AJAX techniques to provide an application-like experience.</p>
                <p>During this time, I also led the technical migration from Oracle RightNow CRM to Salesforce.com Service Cloud.  I oversaw all integrations, custom development, and technical and network
                implementation activities.</p>
                <p>All three of these major projects were undertaken at the same time, under my leadership, concluding on-time with the biggest launch in department history.  During my time
                in this position, I have saved the company over three million dollars in licensing, productivity, and development costs.

                <h3>Yahoo</h3><span class="right">2011-2014</span>
                <h4>Senior Software Development Engineer</h4>
                <h5>Sunnyvale, CA</h5>
                <p>Within the Corporate Applications department, my responsibilities were to manage the SaaS CRM platform from a technology and 
                development standpoint, and contribute to other customer and internal facing web properties and service platforms.  My areas
                of leadership were web technologies and languages, user interface and experience design, and platform architecture. Innovations
                implemented by me at enterprise scale during this period saved the company over two million dollars in licensing, productivity, and development costs.</p>

                <p>Major projects completed during this time included the creation of the Yahoo Unified Support Tool, which is internally used by
                Yahoo agents to more effectively assist the customers, and the RightNow Knowledge Tool (RKT), which creates a services layer and client to be
                used as an integration point between Oracle RightNow CRM and Oracle InQuira Knowledge Base.  After the launch of RKT, I worked with Oracle which resulted
                in a complete redesign of their integration tool to more closely match the functionality of the one I created.</p>

                <h5>Bozeman, MT</h5>
                <p>Working as a volunteer, I designed and developed a new web site for CSC.  The site is functional,  standards compliant, 
                and uses a custom content management system that can easily be updated.   Three non-developer colleagues provided project 
                management, quality assurance, and content loading  for the site.  This project launched and has been live since 2/7/2011.</p>

        While it is a strong passion of mine to learn about advances in technology, there are many other areas
        of my life where I am drawn to explore.<br><br>
 
        I have played guitar for 19 years and also play the bass, drums, and piano.  Growing up in Montana 
        fostered a great appreciation for the outdoors and love of fishing and camping.  Having a family of my
        own allows me the opportunity to teach my love of learning to my children by taking them on exploratory 
        outings to discovery museums, aquariums, and zoos.  I also enjoy playing golf, although it often times 
        gets the better of me.
